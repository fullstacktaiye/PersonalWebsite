            <p>Hello! I'm Taiye Babatope, a student passionate about web development. I am currently enrolled in ISQA3900-850 at the University of Nebraska - Omaha.</p>
            <p>Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a diverse range of interests. I'm an aspiring amateur boxer, training diligently with the goal of competing in a fight soon. When I'm not in the gym or studying, I love sightseeing and the thrill of traveling to new places, experiencing different cultures and landscapes. I'm also deeply fascinated by evolving technologies, particularly the advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its potential impact on our future.</p>
            <p>Through this Web Application Development course, I am eager to significantly enhance my skills in creating and developing websites. My primary goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of modern web technologies and best practices, enabling me to build more sophisticated, user-friendly, and dynamic web applications.</p>
